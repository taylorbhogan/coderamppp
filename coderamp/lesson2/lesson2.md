Everything in tech is made up of smaller things, all the way down to 1s and 0s. We are always working somewhere along that continuum.

Every HTML element is a box. How those boxes behave varies.

HTML elements behave according to the box model. Today we set box-sizing: border-box for a more intuitive, responsiveness-ready developer experience.

HTML elements behave according to normal flow, which by default for us developing in English is horizontal, top to bottom (horizontal-tb). Blocks will appear on new lines, and inline elements will appear to the right of their predecessors.

We can interrupt that flow by invoking an entirely different layout mode, to use a different layout algorithm.
